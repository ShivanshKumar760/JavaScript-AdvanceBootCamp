What are variable?

Well variables are identifiers which are named storage container ie when we declare a variable we basically
assign a name to a memory block in the ram to store the value


Now what are identifier?

Identifiers are the building blocks of a program. Identifiers are unique names that are
assigned to variables, classes, functions, and other entities. They are used to uniquely
identify the entity within the program.They are user define and there name should not match with any of
the keywords that is reserved tokens used in the programs

Rules to Name an Identifier in Programming Language
A programmer has to follow certain rules while naming variables. For the valid identifier,
we must follow the given below set of rules.

An identifier can include letters (a-z or A-Z), and digits (0-9).

An identifier cannot include special characters except the ‘_’ underscore.

Spaces are not allowed while naming an identifier.

An identifier can only begin with an underscore or letters.

We cannot name identifiers the same as keywords because they are reserved words to perform a specific task.
For example, function, class, let, async, await, etc. If we use a keyword’s name as an identifier the
compiler will throw an error.

The identifier must be unique in its namespace.

JS language is case-sensitive so, ‘name’ and ‘NAME’ are different identifiers.
