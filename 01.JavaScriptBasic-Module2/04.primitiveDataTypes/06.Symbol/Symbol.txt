The JavaScript(EcmaScript6) introduced a new primitive data type  [Symbol].Symbols are immutable that is
they cannot be changed and are unique.

Example :
----------
const value1=Symbol("Hello World");
const value2=Symbol("Hello World");
console.log(value1===value2);

Now this will give false value ->why?well although value1 and value2 have same content of type symbol
what symbol does is it converts the content inside it into a unique id and hence although it has same
content its unique thats why(value1 and value2) cant be same as both are unique

*Creating Symbol
->You use the Symbol() function to create symbol

//creating symbol
const x= Symbol();
console.log(typeof x);

->We can pass an optional string as its description

const y=Symbol("hey");
console.log(y)

*Access Symbol
>to access the description of symbol we use [.] operator

const a = Symbol("Hello");
console.log(a.description);
