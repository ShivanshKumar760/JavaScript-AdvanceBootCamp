What is String?
>It is a collection of character enclosed in double or single quote and in js we can use backticks also


Ex:
let stringVariable="hello";

String type
-----------
1.single quote = 'Hello'
2.double quote = "Hello"
3.backticks= `Hello`

Single quote and double quote are practically same and we can use either of them but backticks are
generally used when you need to include variable or expression into a string .This is done by wrapping
variable or expression with[$(variable or expression)]


We can also write a quote inside another quote .However the quote should not match the surroundings quotes.

For Example:
 const name ="My name is "peter"."

 but since both quote are double-quoted it will take the first part as the string ie "My name is " and will
 neglect the part peter"."

To avoid this we use two different quote

const name = "My name is 'peter' .";
