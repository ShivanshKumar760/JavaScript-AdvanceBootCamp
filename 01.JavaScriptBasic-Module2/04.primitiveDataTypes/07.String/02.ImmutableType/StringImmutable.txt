In JavaScript ,String are immutable that means the character of a string cannot be changed

ex:
let a = "hello";
a[0]='J';
//This wont change the first letter of variable 'a' it will be still hello and not Jello
console.log(a);//hello

//However we can assign variable name to new string

let x="hello";
x="bye";
console.log(x);
