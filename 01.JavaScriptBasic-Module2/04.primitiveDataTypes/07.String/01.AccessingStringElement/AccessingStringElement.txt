Since string is a collection of character/letter it can be considered as an array

what is an array:
>array is a collection of similar data type and hence string can be considered as array

Now How to access element of a array for that we use indexing

Indexing is a way to address a element in a ordered way by giving them integer number starting from 0
and goes upto(length of array-1)

string:hello

h e l l 0
0 1 2 3 4--index

Note :index number are always enclosed in square bracket

const a="hello"
console.log(a[1]);//e

#another way to access string character is to use string method ie [.charAt(index)]

const a="hello"
console.log(a.charAt(1));//e
