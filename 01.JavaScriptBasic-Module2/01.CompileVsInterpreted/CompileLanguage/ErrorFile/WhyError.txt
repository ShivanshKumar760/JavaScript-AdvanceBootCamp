So when we tried to execute the following command ie g++ HelloWorld -o HelloWorld to execute
our c++ file it gave us a error


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void)
{
    cout<<"Hello World"<<endl;
    cout<<a<<endl;
    return 0;
}

g++ HelloWorld.cpp -o HelloWorld
HelloWorld.cpp: In function 'int main()':
HelloWorld.cpp:6:11: error: 'a' was not declared in this scope
     cout<<a<<endl;

Now error says that a was not declared ie a is a identifier which is not been declared into the
memory to be used to it gave us a error that this is an unknown entity in this scope so it cannot
be executed but before cout<<a<<endl; there is another line which is :

cout<<"Hello World"<<endl;

why this was not executed?well if it was a interpreted language like python or javascript which
execute code line by line this line of code would have executed but since c++ is a compiled
language it first transcribe whole code into binary and then execute it but if the code has some
error in it then code wont be converted into binary
