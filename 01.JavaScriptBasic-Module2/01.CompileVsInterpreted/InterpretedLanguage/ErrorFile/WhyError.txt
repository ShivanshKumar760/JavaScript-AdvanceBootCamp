code :
    console.log("Hello World!");
    console.log(a);

So when we ran the command (node Error.js) to execute the Error.js file gave us o/p

node Error.js
Hello World!
/mnt/d/coding/development/Web Development/Cohort/01.Week1/01.CompileVsInterpreted/InterpretedLanguage/ErrorFile/Error.js:2
console.log(a);
            ^

ReferenceError: a is not defined
    at Object.<anonymous> (/mnt/d/coding/development/Web Development/Cohort/01.Week1/01.CompileVsInterpreted/InterpretedLanguage/ErrorFile/Error.js:2:13)
    at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:999:30)

    at internal/main/run_main_module.js:17:47

Now here as we can see the first line of code ran perfectly without an error thats because js
is a interpreted language and it converts each line of code into 0s and 1s one by one but the
second line gave us a error cause a was an unknown entity it wasnt declared in the scope to be
executed
