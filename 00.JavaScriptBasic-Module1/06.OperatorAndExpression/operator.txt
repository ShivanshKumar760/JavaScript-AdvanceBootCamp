A fragment of code that produce a value is called an expression.Every Value written litreally is called an expression for ex: 77; or "harry"  


Operator :

1.Arithmetic operator -
+   Addition Operator
-   subtraction operator
*   multiplication operator
/   Division operator
**  Exponential operator
%   Remainder  operator
++  increment by +1
--  decrement by -1

2.Assignment Operator
= equal to
+= equal to and then plus so ex:a+=b--a=a+b
-= equal to and then subtract,ex:a-=b -- a=a-b
*= equal to and then multiply
/= equal to and then divide 
%= equal to and then assign remainder to it
**=equal to and then assign exponential value to it
++= equal to and increment it 
--= equal to and decrement it

3.Comparission operator 
== equal to that is check if two variable have equal data
!= not equal to 
=== equal value and type
!== not equal value or type
> greater
< less 
>= greater then or equal to
<= less than or equal to
? terenary operator


4.Logical operator
&& and aka logical and
|| logical or 
! not 

logical operator operates on boolean value
