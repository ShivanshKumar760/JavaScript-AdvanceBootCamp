What is an array?

Ans:- array is an object that represents a collection of similar type of elements.

Array can be declared using 3 different methods -
1.By array literal
2.By creating instance of Array directly (using new keyword)
3.By using an Array constructor (using new keyword)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Synatx to declare array is :-

var arrayname=[value1,value2.....valueN];  //value should be of same data type

I)JavaScript array literal

The syntax of creating array using array literal is given below:

var arrayname=[value1,value2.....valueN];  
As you can see, values are contained inside [ ] and separated by , (comma).

Let's see the simple example of creating and using array in JavaScript.

var guestList=["Sahil","Upasana","Shivansh","Chitra"];

this is a array of string values which is used to represent a guest list

the elements of an array can be accessed individually using indexing .

Indexing refer to numbering the position of elements from 0 to n-1 where n is the size of
array calculated from 1 to n so if array size is 10 then indexing will be from 0 to 9
guestList[0]//"Sahil"
guestList[1] // will give answer "Upasana"


2) JavaScript Array directly (new keyword)
The syntax of creating array directly is given below:

var arrayname=new Array();  
Here, new keyword is used to create instance of array.


var emp = new Array();  
emp[0] = "Arun";  
emp[1] = "Varun";  
emp[2] = "John";   
}  


3) JavaScript array constructor (new keyword)
Here, you need to create instance of array by passing arguments in constructor so that we don't have to provide value explicitly.

The example of creating object by array constructor is given below.

  
var emp=new Array("Jai","Vijay","Smith");
