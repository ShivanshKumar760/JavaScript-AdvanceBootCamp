Variable is container to store a value ,this is very similar to conatainer used to store rice similary in javascript variable we can store value like number , string ,array--collection of number or string 

Now this container variable is place in memory location which store this value.

The data type of variable in javascript can be change anytime when ever we want that is suppose if we created a variable with initial value having number we can later assign the variable to a string.


ex of decalring variable in c and javascript

C          

int a;
a=2;
//changing data
a="hey";//this line will give error in C cause we have defined a variable as a int type so it cannot store a string value


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JavaScript

var a =2;
a="hey"//this wont produce any error 

and thats why javascript is dynamically typed language and it modify its variable type depending on the value given.
