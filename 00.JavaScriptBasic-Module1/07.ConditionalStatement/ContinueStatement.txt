continue
The continue statement terminates execution of the statements in the current iteration of the current or labeled loop, and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration.

Syntax :

continue;


Example:
--------
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}

Description
In contrast to the break statement, continue does not terminate the execution of the loop entirely, but instead:

In a while loop, it jumps back to the condition.
In a for loop, it jumps to the update expression.
The continue statement can include an optional label that allows the program to jump to the next iteration of a labeled loop statement instead of the current loop. In this case, the continue statement needs to be nested within this labeled statement.
