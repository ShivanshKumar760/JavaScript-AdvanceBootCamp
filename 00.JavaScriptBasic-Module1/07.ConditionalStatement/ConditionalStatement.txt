CONDITIONAL STATEMENT :

Sometimes we might have to execute a block of code based on some condition.
For example a prompt on screen might ask for the age of the user and if its greater then 18 it should display a special message.

and this is where comes the role of conditional statement which executes a block of code if the condition given is true.

In JavaScript we have three forms of if-else statement.
1.if statement
2.if...else statement
3.if...else if...else Statement

Syntax of conditional statement

1.if

if(condtion--true)
{
	//code block;
}
-------------------
2.if--else

if(condtion--false)
{
	//code block will not get executed in this case
}
//and command flow will shift to  else
else
{
	//code block to get executed
}
------------------------------------------------------------

3.if--else if--else

when we have more than one condition to check on then we use if--else if--else.

if(condition1)
{
	//condition1 true then  this block of code will get execute
} 
//condition1 if fails flow of control gets shifted
else if(condition2)
{
	//condition2 true then this block of code will get executed
}
else
{
	//block of code 
}
