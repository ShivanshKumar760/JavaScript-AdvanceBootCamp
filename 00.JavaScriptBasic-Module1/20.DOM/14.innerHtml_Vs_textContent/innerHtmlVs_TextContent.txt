So In Dom manipulation we can maipulate text using JavaScript by two ways:

1.innerHTML
2.textContent

How to use both of them :

1.document.querySelector("tag_name").innerHTML="value";

2.document.querySelector("tag_name").textContent="value";


Now at first they might seem same but actually there working is  different 
well innerHTML as the name suggests return anything inside a perticular html tag
like:

<h1><strong>Hello</strong></h1>

document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML;
>>><strong>Hello</strong>//that is it returned the html residing inside the h1 tag

but if we use textContent it only returns the text content to be shown on the browser.

document.querySelector("h1").textContent;
>>>Hello

And cause of that with innerHTML we can manipulation the way our text should look by adding html
tag inside innerHTML proerty


document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML="<em>Hey,What'up</em>;

but we cant do the same thing with textContent
document.querySelector("h1").textContentL="<em>Hey,What'up</em>;//error undefined



When you set the textContent property, all child nodes are removed and replaced by only one new text node.
