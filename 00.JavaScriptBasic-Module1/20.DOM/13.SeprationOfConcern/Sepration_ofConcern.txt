Q.WHAT IS SEPRATION OF CONCERN ?
-----------------------------------
Ans:-Sepration of concern is related to how our website works well we know that,

HTML--is used to structure our website and CSS -- is used to style our website 
whereas JavaScript is used to handle functionality of the website

But in our previous directories we havent been able to follow this rule of thumb as we are using
JavaScript to manipulate style of our website which it can be used for but it should be more used 
for functionality,

Now one might argue that what if we are on a website and we click onto a object and it changes 
color So here by clicking on a object we want our element color to change that is its style property
to change hence  we can use JavaScript to chnage the style property ,well the answer is yes we can

but the more suitable way  or a optimal solution or approch would be a property offered by 
document object that is the classList

So suppose we have a html file here
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <button class="btn">Click me </button>
        <script src="i.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>

CSS
-----
.btn{
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    
}

//Now what we want in this site is that when we click on the button its color changes to yellow

There are few ways we can look at :
1)
EventListener()//Will read button click 
{
    //if EventListener is true:
    document.querySelector("button").style.backgroundColor ="yellow";
}
/*
Now this can be done but eventually we  are just manipulating style we need to add functionality 
*/

//for that we can use classList

Syntax:
document.querySelector("button").classList;
DOMTokenList:["btn",value:"btn"]//btn is the class associated with button tag

2)We can predefine some style for on clicking button and then by using JavaScript
we can add a class in button tag provinding a functionality to button tag without 
touching it's style property and doing the job.


<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <button class="btn">Click me </button>
        <script src="i.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>

CSS
-----
.btn{
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    
}

.onCLickButton
{
    backgroundColor:"yellow";
    }


JS 
----

EventListener(true)
{
    document.querySelector("button").classList.add("onCLickButton");
}


And not pnly we can add class but we can remove the class as well with:

document.querySelector("button").classList.remove("onCLickButton");


Another method in classList is toggle which is like a on off Switch 

document.querySelector("button").classList.remove("btn");
