function is specific to that function and when we will try to access it  outside the 
function it will give error saying not declared .

similarly if we try to access f variable decalred  using let keyword like:

console.log(f);

This will give error ,although let is no function specific but since function starts 
and end with curly brackets {} all the code written inside of them becomes scope specifc
in a way since block is anything which is written inside curly bracket and let keyword
is block specific.So if we try to access variable declared inside a function using let
keyword  it will give error.
