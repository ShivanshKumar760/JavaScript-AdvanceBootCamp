In JavaScript ,both the keywords ie [var] and [let] are used to declare variable .

The let keyword was introduced by or in the later version of javascript known is EcmaScript6 or Just ES6(ES2016).And its the prefferd way to decalre a variable in javascript.

JavaScript let VS var 
----------------------

Here's the overview of the difference between let and var

let                                                    |      var 
                                                       |
->let is block scoped                                  |->var is function scoped.
->let does not allow redeclaration of Variable         |->var allows redeclaration of variable.
->Hoisting does not occur in let                       |->Hoisting occur in var.



I.Var is function scoped.
-----------------------
The variable declared using var keyword inside a function can be used anywhere witin the function but not outside of the function.

for example:

function greet()
{
	var a ="hello";
	console.log(a);//variable a can be used anywhere in function greet()

}
//but cannot ben used here .
greet();//hello
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


II.let is block-scoped.
------------------------
The variable declared with [let] can only be used or accessed inside a block of code .

For example:

function greet()
{
	let a="hello";
	//a will act as a global variable for if block cause a is local variable for function greet()
	//and if block is under greet() function and a is dcalared outside the if block()

	//although b cannot be used outside if block.
	if (a=="hello")
	{
		//b can be used here but b cannot be used outside of this if block
		let b = "world";
		console.log(a+" "+b);

	}
	//variable b cannot be used here 
	console.log(a+" "+b);//this will throw an error.



}
//variable a cannot be used outside the function as it is bounded by the block.

greet();
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Output :
hello world
uncaught Reference :b is not defined error

In the above program , the variable [a] is decalred inside the function and it can be accessed anywhere inside that function greet(){[a] becomes function scoped.}

However the variable[b] is declared inside the if block statement .[b] will be block-scoped and only be accessed inside the if block.

Hence when we try to access b outside if block it gives an error (as shown in above program.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:The variable declared inside the function using var and let are both function scoped
