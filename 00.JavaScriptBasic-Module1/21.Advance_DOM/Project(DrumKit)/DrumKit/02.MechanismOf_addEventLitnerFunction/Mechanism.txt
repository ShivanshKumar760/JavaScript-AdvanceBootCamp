Mechanism of Event Listner function in JavaScript 
--------------------------------------------------
so before actually seeing the Mechanism of addEventListener() function in JavaScript
lets see it's syntax:

    addEventListener("event", function_name);

so if you see addEventListener() is a function which takes another function name as an input 
but till now all the function we saw only took parameter which are of data type int , float
,String or maybe an array like the below:

function add(x,y)
{
    return x+y;
}

let x=5;
let y=4;
console.log(add(x,y));
//so as we can see till now we use to make a function and pass parameter into it which
were mostly variable like the above program but we never passed a function in another function
as a argument.

Well this concept of One function taking another function as a parameter is known as 
High Order Function:

What are High Order Function ?
-------------------------------
A High Order Function is a function which takes one or more functions as a parameter/argument,or 
return a function as a result.

Ex:
function greet(gretting)
{
    return `Hi!! ${name}';
}

function greet_msg(msg,name,greeting)<----------------------------------------------------
{  //and from here greet_msg will call greet() function                                                                                      |
    return '${greet(name)} $msg';                                                        |
}                                                                                        |
greet_msg("Welcome to js","Shivansh",greet);   //will call greet_msg and control will go to 

output:

Hi!!Shivansh Welcome to js

function such as filter(),map(),reduce(),addEventListener() etc are all example of Higher 
Order Functions.


Note the function we pass as an argument to another function is called the callback function .
