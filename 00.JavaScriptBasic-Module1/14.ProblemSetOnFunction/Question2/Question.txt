BMI Calculator Challenge
Create a BMI calculator using JavaScript functions. 

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a way of estimating the amount of body fat. It's used in medicine to calculate risk of heart disease.

You can calculate it using the formula below, where weight divided by height squared.

bmi=weight/height*height



Your challenge is to create a function that takes weight and height as inputs and gives the calculated BMI value as an output. The output should be rounded to the nearest whole number.
